# The Bartender
Have you ever felt **sad** and **alone**? Well don’t worry, we have a solution for you.

The Bartender is a bot made for you to fill your dead, empty heart. It will help you overcome your sadness with it’s shitty sense of humor and it’s lame jokes. With The Bartender by your side there is no way you can feel alone, that’s for sure (you will end up muting it, I promise you).

## Invite:
The Bartender is not running 24/7, or at least not always (mainly because it’s hosted in a crappy 2005 computer/server in my bedroom so yeah), but I personally consider it a hilarious addition to any server. So if you want to have The Bartender on your Discord server just use [this invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=731744504184307743&permissions=104324672&scope=bot).

## Usage:
**DISCLAIMER:** The Bartender isn't built for anyone to deploy it, it has a very specific behaviour and it isn't portable. But I'm not here to tell you what to do.
```bash
npm run build # Compile the /src folder into /lib
npm run start # Run the bot
npm run watch-build # Continuously watch for changes and re-compile
npm run watch-start # Continuously watch for changes and restart the server (it also enables the debugger)
```
**NOTE:** For voice synthesizing [espeak-ng](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng) is used (so yeah, you will need it).

## Contributing:
**NOTE:** Please note that this project just began, so the code strucure is very likely to change entirely.
Pull requests are more than welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## Todo:
```
- [X] initial project setup
- [ ] useful documentation
- [ ] data consistency (adding a database???)
- [ ] tests
```

## Content:
*Anything the bot says or does is meant to be as a joke, and it **should not be taken seriously**. I am sorry if something offends you.*
